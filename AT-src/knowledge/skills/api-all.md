# Part 1: API Recon & Docs


# SKILL: API Recon and Docs — Endpoints, Schemas, and Version Surface

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Use this skill first when the target is a REST, mobile, or GraphQL API and you need to enumerate endpoints, documentation, versions, and hidden surface area before exploitation.

## 1. PRIMARY GOALS

1. Discover all reachable API entrypoints.
2. Extract schemas, optional fields, and role differences.
3. Identify old versions, mobile paths, GraphQL endpoints, and undocumented parameters.

## 2. RECON CHECKLIST

### JavaScript and client mining

```bash
curl https://target/app.js | grep -oE '(/api|/rest|/graphql)[^"'\'' ]+' | sort -u
```

### Common documentation and schema paths

```text
/swagger.json
/openapi.json
/api-docs
/docs
/.well-known/
/graphql
/gql
```

### Version and product drift

```text
/api/v1/
/api/v2/
/api/mobile/v1/
/legacy/
```

## 3. WHAT TO EXTRACT FROM DOCS

- optional and undocumented fields
- admin-only request examples
- deprecated endpoints that may still be active
- schema hints like `additionalProperties: true`
- parameter names tied to filtering, sorting, IDs, roles, or tenancy

## 4. NEXT ROUTING

| Finding | Next Skill |
|---|---|
| object IDs everywhere | [api authorization and bola](../api-authorization-and-bola/SKILL.md) |
| JWT, OAuth, role claims | [api auth and jwt abuse](../api-auth-and-jwt-abuse/SKILL.md) |
| GraphQL or hidden fields | [graphql and hidden parameters](../graphql-and-hidden-parameters/SKILL.md) |
| strong auth boundary but suspicious business flow | [business logic vulnerabilities](../business-logic-vulnerabilities/SKILL.md) |

# Part 2: API Authorization & BOLA


# SKILL: API Authorization and BOLA — Object Access, Function Access, and Mass Assignment

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Use this skill when an API exposes object IDs, nested resources, or role-sensitive functions and you need a focused authorization test path: BOLA, BFLA, method abuse, and hidden field control.

## 1. CORE TEST LOOP

1. Create Account A and Account B.
2. As Account A, capture create, read, update, and delete flows.
3. Replay with Account B's token.
4. Test sibling endpoints, nested endpoints, and alternate HTTP verbs.

## 2. TEST SURFACES

| Surface | Example |
|---|---|
| object read | `/api/v1/orders/123` |
| nested object | `/api/v1/users/1/invoices/9` |
| admin or internal function | `/api/v1/admin/users` |
| update path | `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` variants |
| hidden JSON fields | `role`, `org`, `verified`, `tier` |

## 3. QUICK PAYLOADS

```json
{"role":"admin"}
{"isAdmin":true}
{"org":"target-company"}
{"verified":true}
```

## 4. WHAT TESTERS MISS

- object IDs in headers, cookies, GraphQL args, and nested objects
- alternate methods sharing the same route but weaker authz
- parent check present, child resource check missing
- admin docs revealing extra writable fields

## 5. NEXT ROUTING

- For JWT or token-layer abuse: [api auth and jwt abuse](../api-auth-and-jwt-abuse/SKILL.md)
- For GraphQL and hidden parameter discovery: [graphql and hidden parameters](../graphql-and-hidden-parameters/SKILL.md)
- For broader IDOR patterns outside APIs: [idor broken object authorization](../idor-broken-object-authorization/SKILL.md)

# Part 3: API Auth & JWT Abuse


# SKILL: API Auth and JWT Abuse — Token Trust, Header Tricks, and Rate Limits

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Use this skill when APIs rely on JWT, bearer tokens, API keys, or weak request identity signals. Focus on token trust boundaries, claim misuse, header spoofing, and rate-limit bypass.

## 1. TOKEN TRIAGE

Inspect:

- `alg`, `kid`, `jku`, `x5u`
- role, org, tenant, scope, or privilege claims
- issuer and audience mismatches
- reuse of mobile and web tokens across products

## 2. QUICK ATTACK PICKS

| Pattern | First Test |
|---|---|
| `alg:none` acceptance | unsigned token with trailing dot |
| RS256 confusion | switch to HS256 using public key as secret |
| `kid` lookup trust | path traversal or injection in `kid` |
| remote key fetch trust | attacker-controlled `jku` or `x5u` |
| weak secret | offline crack with targeted wordlists |

## 3. HIDDEN FIELDS AND BATCH ABUSE

### Mass assignment field picks

```text
role
isAdmin
admin
verified
plan
tier
permissions
org
owner
```

### Rate limit and batch abuse picks

```text
X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4
X-Real-IP: 5.6.7.8
Forwarded: for=9.9.9.9
```

GraphQL or JSON batch abuse candidates:

- arrays of login mutations
- bulk object fetches with varying IDs
- repeated password reset or verification calls in one request

## 4. RATE LIMIT BYPASS FAMILIES

```text
X-Forwarded-For
X-Real-IP
Forwarded
User-Agent rotation
Path case / slash variants
```

## 5. NEXT ROUTING

- For GraphQL batching and hidden parameters: [graphql and hidden parameters](../graphql-and-hidden-parameters/SKILL.md)
- For default credential and brute-force planning: [authentication bypass](../authbypass-authentication-flaws/SKILL.md)
- For full JWT and OAuth depth: [jwt oauth token attacks](../jwt-oauth-token-attacks/SKILL.md)
- For OAuth or OIDC configuration flaws in browser and SSO flows: [oauth oidc misconfiguration](../oauth-oidc-misconfiguration/SKILL.md)
- For credentialed browser reads and origin trust bugs: [cors cross origin misconfiguration](../cors-cross-origin-misconfiguration/SKILL.md)

# Part 4: GraphQL & Hidden Parameters


# SKILL: GraphQL and Hidden Parameters — Introspection, Batching, and Undocumented Fields

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Use this skill when GraphQL exists or when REST documentation suggests optional, deprecated, or undocumented fields. Focus on schema discovery, hidden parameter abuse, and batching as a force multiplier.

## 1. GRAPHQL FIRST PASS

```graphql
query { __typename }
query {
  __schema {
    types { name }
  }
}
```

If introspection is restricted, continue with:

- field suggestions and error-based discovery
- known type probes like `__type(name: "User")`
- JS and mobile bundle route extraction

## 2. HIGH-VALUE GRAPHQL TESTS

| Theme | Example |
|---|---|
| IDOR | `user(id: "victim")` |
| batching | array of login or object fetch operations |
| hidden fields | admin-only fields exposed in type definitions |
| nested authz gaps | related object fields with weaker checks |

## 3. HIDDEN PARAMETER DISCOVERY

Look for:

- fields present in admin docs but not public docs
- `additionalProperties` or permissive schemas
- frontend code using richer request bodies than visible UI controls
- mobile endpoints carrying role, org, feature-flag, or internal filter fields

## 4. NEXT ROUTING

- If hidden fields affect privilege: [api authorization and bola](../api-authorization-and-bola/SKILL.md)
- If GraphQL batching changes auth or rate behavior: [api auth and jwt abuse](../api-auth-and-jwt-abuse/SKILL.md)
- If endpoint discovery is incomplete: [api recon and docs](../api-recon-and-docs/SKILL.md)
